A mix between the native iOS 8 gallery and facebooks image picker.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.<br />
To use it in you own project
###### Swift
```swift
import BSImagePicker

let imagePicker = ImagePickerController()

presentImagePicker(imagePicker, select: { (asset) in
    // User selected an asset. Do something with it. Perhaps begin processing/upload?
}, deselect: { (asset) in
    // User deselected an asset. Cancel whatever you did when asset was selected.
}, cancel: { (assets) in
    // User canceled selection. 
}, finish: { (assets) in
    // User finished selection assets.
})
```
## Features
* Multiple selection.
* Fullscreen preview
* Switch albums.
* Images, live image and videos supported.
* Customizable - check out Settings to see what you can tweak.

## Customization

You have access to the cancel, album and done button. Customize them as you would with any other UIBarButtonItem (cancel & finish) or UIButton (album).<br />
There are also a few other settings you can tweak. They are documented in BSImagePickerSettings.<br />
